# be-healthy
A program for tracking and visualizing health data.

## Getting Started
The program is still a very early work in progress, but if you want to check it out anyways, here's how:

1. Make sure you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) installed with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) activated.
2. Execute the run.sh script with the following command:
```
bash run.sh
```
